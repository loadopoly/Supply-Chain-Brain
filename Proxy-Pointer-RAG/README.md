**Structural RAG for Document Analysis** — A hierarchical, pointer-based RAG pipeline that retrieves full document sections using structural tree navigation instead of blind vector similarity.

## How It Works

```mermaid

    A[PDF Documents] -->|LlamaParse| B[Markdown Files]
    B -->|Skeleton Tree Builder| C[Structure Trees]
    C -->|LLM Noise Filter| D[Content Nodes]
    B --> E[Text Chunks]

    I -->|LLM Re-Ranker| J[Top 5 Nodes]
    J -->|Load Full Sections| K[Rich Context]
    K -->|LLM Synthesizer| L[Answer]
```

Instead of retrieving small, context-less chunks, Proxy-Pointer:

1. **Builds a structural tree** of each document (like a table of contents) — pure Python, no external deps
2. **Filters noise** (TOC, abbreviations, foreword, etc.) using an LLM
3. **Indexes structural pointers** — each chunk carries metadata about its position in the document hierarchy
4. **Re-ranks by structure** — an LLM re-ranker selects the most relevant sections by their hierarchical path, not just embedding similarity
5. **Loads full sections** — the synthesizer sees complete document sections, not truncated 2000-char chunks

---

## Architecture Deep Dive

The Proxy-Pointer retrieval architecture uses hierarchical skeleton trees built from document structure to retrieve full sections by structural path rather than blind vector similarity. See `src/indexing/` for the full implementation.

## Benchmark Results

Proxy-Pointer has been evaluated against the **[FinanceBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PatronusAI/financebench)** dataset using four FY2022 10-K filings (AMD, American Express, Boeing, PepsiCo). In addition, I created a list of 40 significantly more complex and advanced questions requiring multi-step reasoning and calculations, causal and atribution analysis, adversarial reasoning, which I named **Comprehensive** benchmark. The results are as follows:

| Benchmark                    | Questions                      | k_final | Accuracy                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- | ----------------------- |
| FinanceBench (26 questions)  | Qualitative + quantitative     | k=5     | **100%** (26/26)  |
| FinanceBench (26 questions)  | Qualitative + quantitative     | k=3     | **96.2%** (25/26) |
| Comprehensive (40 questions) | Complex financial calculations | k=5     | **100%** (40/40)  |
| Comprehensive (40 questions) | Complex financial calculations | k=3     | **92.5%** (37/40) |

Full scorecards and comparison logs are available in `data/Benchmark/`. Refer the `Comprehensive k=5` and `Comprehensive k=3` folders for the detailed logs and scorecards.

## 5-Minute Quickstart

A pre-extracted Markdown file (`AMD.md`) for AMD's FY2022 10-K is included so you can build the index and start querying immediately — no PDF extraction required.

> **Want to try more companies?** Additional Markdown files for American Express, Boeing, and PepsiCo are available in `data/documents/md_files/`. Copy them into `data/documents/` and rebuild the index.

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/loadopoly/Proxy-Pointer-RAG.git
cd Proxy-Pointer-RAG
```

### 2. Create virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure API keys

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env → add your GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

### 5. Build the index

To build the FAISS index from scratch for the first time:
```bash
python -m src.indexing.build_pp_index --fresh
```

*(Note: If you add more documents later, simply run `python -m src.indexing.build_pp_index` without the `--fresh` flag to incrementally append only the new files!)*

### 6. Start querying

```bash
python -m src.agent.pp_rag_bot
```

Try a query like:

```
User >> What is AMD's quick ratio for FY2022? Quick ratio is Quick Assets (Cash and cash equivalents + Short-term investments + Accounts receivable, net) by current liabilities
or a more advanced comparative one:
User >> For AMD, what percentage of total revenue growth from FY2021 to FY2022 is attributable to the Embedded segment (including Xilinx)?
```

## Running Benchmarks

The benchmark script evaluates the pipeline against an Excel dataset containing `Question` and `Answer` (or `Ground Truth`) columns. It runs each question through the bot, uses an LLM-as-a-judge to grade the response, and generates a timestamped log and scorecard in `data/results/`.

We provide a robust Comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the bot across all four dataset companies (AMD, AMEX, Boeing, and PepsiCo). Because only AMD is indexed by default in the quickstart, process the following steps to run the benchmark successfully:

1. **Copy the remaining documents:** Move all `.md` files from `data/documents/md_files/` into the main `data/documents/` directory.
2. **Rebuild the index:** Run the indexer from scratch to ensure the bot has the data required to answer questions for the other companies:
   ```bash
   python -m src.indexing.build_pp_index --fresh
   ```
3. **Execute the benchmark:** Run the evaluation script against the provided Comprehensive dataset (or replace the path with your own Excel file):
   ```bash
   python -m src.agent.benchmark "data/Benchmark/Comprehensive k=5/Test_Questions.xlsx"
   ```

## Adding Your Own Documents

### Option A: You already have Markdown files

1. Place `.md` files in `data/documents/`
2. Run the indexer (uses incremental indexing to only process new files):
   ```bash
   python -m src.indexing.build_pp_index
   ```
   *(Add `--fresh` if you want to completely erase the existing index and rebuild from scratch).*

### Option B: Start from PDFs

1. Add `LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY` to your `.env` file
2. Place PDFs in `data/pdf/`
3. Extract to markdown:
   ```bash
   python -m src.extraction.extract_pdf_to_md
   ```
4. Build the index (incrementally adds the newly extracted PDFs):
   ```bash
   python -m src.indexing.build_pp_index
   ```

## Components

### 1. Extraction Layer (`src/extraction/`)

**PDF → Markdown** via LlamaParse.

- Preserves document hierarchy (headings, tables, lists)
- Outputs one `.md` file per PDF
- Idempotent: skips already-extracted files
- **Note:** Accurate markdown with headings identified is crucial for the pipeline to work correctly. If the default `cost_effective` tier is not sufficient, run with a higher tier by selecting a different value for the `LLAMA_PARSE_TIER` environment variable in config.py.

### 2. Indexing Layer (`src/indexing/`)

Three-stage pipeline:

#### Stage 0: Skeleton Tree Building (`build_skeleton_trees.py`)

- Self-contained, pure-Python module (~150 lines) that parses Markdown headings into a hierarchical tree
- Tree nodes represent document sections with `node_id`, `title`, and `line_num`
- Zero external dependencies — no LLM calls, no subprocess invocations

#### Stage 1: LLM Noise Filter

- Sends the skeleton tree JSON to Gemini Flash Lite
- Identifies noise nodes across 6 categories:
  - Table of Contents
  - Abbreviations / Glossary
  - Acknowledgments
  - Foreword / Preface
  - Executive Summary
  - References / Bibliography
- Returns a set of `node_id`s to exclude
- Temperature 0.0 for deterministic results

#### Stage 2: Chunk, Embed, Index

- For each non-noise node:
  - Extracts text between `line_num` boundaries
  - Parent nodes: text stops at first child's `line_num` (no overlap with children)
  - Splits into 2000-char chunks with 200-char overlap
  - Enriches with hierarchical breadcrumb: `[Parent > Child > Section]\nchunk_text`
  - Stores metadata: `doc_id`, `node_id`, `title`, `breadcrumb`, `start_line`, `end_line`
- Embeds with `gemini-embedding-001` at **1536 dimensions** (half of default 3072)
- Saves as FAISS index

### 3. Retrieval Layer (`src/agent/`)

Two-stage retrieval:

#### Stage 1: Broad Vector Recall

- Embeds query with same 1536-dim model
- FAISS similarity search returns top 200 chunks
- Deduplicates by `node_id` and shortlists to the **Top 50** unique candidate nodes

#### Stage 2: LLM Structural Re-Ranker

- Sends candidate hierarchical paths (breadcrumbs) to Gemini
- LLM ranks by **structural relevance**, not embedding similarity
- Returns top 5 unique node IDs
- Fallback: if re-ranker fails, uses top 5 by similarity

#### Synthesis

- For each selected node: loads the **full section text** from the source `.md` file using `start_line` / `end_line` pointers
- Injects breadcrumb as `### REFERENCE` header for grounding
- Gemini synthesizes a grounded answer citing sources

## Design Decisions

### Why 1536 dimensions?

Gemini's `gemini-embedding-001` defaults to 3072 dimensions. We use `output_dimensionality=1536`:

- **50% smaller** FAISS index files
- **Faster** similarity search
- **Minimal accuracy loss** — for structural retrieval (breadcrumb matching), the re-ranker does the heavy lifting; embeddings just need to get the right candidates into the top 200

### Why LLM noise filter instead of regex?

Hardcoded title matching (`NOISE_TITLES = {"contents", "foreword", ...}`) breaks on:

- Variations: "Note of Thanks" vs "Acknowledgments"
- Formatting: "**Table of Contents**" vs "TABLE OF CONTENTS"
- Language: concept-based matching catches semantic equivalents

### Why structural re-ranker?

Standard vector RAG returns chunks by embedding similarity. A query about "AMD's cash flow" might surface a paragraph that **mentions** cash flow, but the actual Cash Flow Statement table is structurally elsewhere. The re-ranker sees `AMD > Financial Statements > Cash Flows` as a breadcrumb and knows it's the right section.

### Why full-section loading?

The indexed chunk is max 2000 chars — often just a fragment of a table or section. The synthesizer needs the **complete** section (including headers, full tables, footnotes) for accurate answers. The chunk acts as a **pointer**; the full section is the **payload**.
